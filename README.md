What to submit to Antinews?
---------------------------
A good submission to Antinews has two things:

1) is not news (i.e. the value of the submission is not time-specific), and 
2) has high educational value.

Good submissions: an introduction to Kolmogorov complexity, programming languages implementation, an article on Ruby optimization. Bad submissions: Techcrunch articles, startup acquisitions, most opinion pieces. 

Blatant self promotion is a bad submission. Self-promotion isn't what this site is about (refer to good submissions, above). Linking to your site and asking for feedback is ok so long as the post is honest. Remember that self promotion can be earned â€” if you consistently post thought-provoking comments or links on the site, people will click through to your profile to know you better.

In a nutshell, everything that detracts from a good learning experience is a bad submission to Antinews.

Don't be creepy. You know that guy. Don't be that guy.

Do unto others as you would be done unto you. That means not saying things you wouldn't say in a face to face conversation.

Reply to the argument, don't call names. "You obviously don't know what you're talking about, X is Y, not Z." can be shortened to "X is Y, not Z."

Don't complain about downvotes. Nothing can be done about it, and it's rather boring to read.

Don't uppercase for emphasis. Markdown is enabled across this site; use it.
